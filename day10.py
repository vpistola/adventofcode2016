Day 10: Balance Bots

In this puzzle, a fleet of robots exchange some chips from input bins, passing them among themselves, and eventually putting them in output bins. We are given instructions like this:

	value 5 goes to bot 2
	bot 2 gives low to bot 1 and high to bot 0
	value 3 goes to bot 1
	bot 1 gives low to output 1 and high to bot 0
	bot 0 gives low to output 2 and high to output 0
	value 2 goes to bot 2
